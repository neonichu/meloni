meloni
======

This project aims to use cucumber for testing iOS applications. While there
is prior work which does that (iCuke), meloni wants to stay clean off 
modifying the application, it aims to use plain UIAutomation and Instruments
for test execution. To achieve that, it automatically generates JavaScript
code for running the tests.

Examples:

Look in the directory named thusly. The tests are for 
PlainNote (https://github.com/vkoser/PlainNote).

Licensing:

BSD.

Notes:

* cucumber is required (gem install gherkin cucumber)
* currently, meloni is limited to generating scripts, it cannot execute
	the tests automatically
* some UIAutomation methods are not yet implemented
